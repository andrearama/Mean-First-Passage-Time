# Mean-First-Passage-Time
This repository contains functions for computing MFPT and ATT for random walks and anomalous random walks on complex systems.
The theory underline comes from the papers  “Mean first-passage time for random walks on undirected networks” (2011), by Zhongzhi Zhang Alafate Julaiti, Baoyu Hou, Hongjuan Zhang, and Guanrong Chen and "Navigation by anomalous random walks on complex networks", by Tongfeng Weng, Jie Zhang, Moein Khajehnejad, Michael Small, Rui Zheng & Pan Hui.
